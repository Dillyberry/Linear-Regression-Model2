# Linear-Regression-Model2
I was just trying out some assignments on using the label Encoder to do some predictions on a small data set. Find below the questions I played with:
1) Predict price of a mercedez benz that is 4 yr old with mileage 45000
2) Predict price of a BMW X5 that is 7 yr old with mileage 86000
3) Tell me the score (accuracy) of your model. (Hint: use LinearRegression().score())
4) Predict price of a Audi A5 that is 3 yr old with mileage 30000
5) Predict price of a BMW X5 that is 2 yr old with mileage 40000
6)Predict the price of a mercedez benz tthat is 1 year old with mileage 20000.
7)Predict the price of a mercedez benz t that is 4 years old with mileage 40000.
